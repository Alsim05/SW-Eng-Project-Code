# SW-Eng-Project-Code

I have changed the names of the "contact_details" files - both the HTML and PHP ones -
to "registration_page". 
I have also just added 2 new files - one in HTML and one in PHP = and named them "data_retrieval".
They are primarily for use by the Service Procider - i.e. me - so I can check the contact details
of any given user / member of my website.

After loads of trial and error, I have decided to rather have all my php code inside one file, which I
have names as "unified_file.php"
